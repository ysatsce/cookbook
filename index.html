        <p>Hi pookie! This is a small project I've been working on for a few months, whenever I've had time.
            I know you're not much of a culinarist or whatever, but you do seem to enjoy my cooking. I made this
            website so you can find recipes for some of the stuff I cook. When I'm not there to cook for you (or
            I just don't feel like cooking), you can open up this site and find something to cook.
        </p>
