        <p><a href="https://mxriyum.com/" title="Mariyum">Mariyum</a> is one of the best cooks 
        I've come across on social media, and her recipes are really easy to follow. She's also 
        on TikTok, but I think it's easier to follow recipes that are just text and you don't have 
        to keep scrolling back and forth all the time to find the right timestamps for different 
        parts of the recipes.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tinekeyounger?lang=en" title="Chef Tini's TikTok">Chef Tini</a> 
        is a TikTok-famous chef who made the insanely viral Mac & Cheese recipe last year, which I 
        remember sending you photos of lol. As far as I'm aware she doesn't have a blog like Mariym, 
        but I like using her TikTok for inspo. If you, for some reason, ever feel like watching 
        cooking videos, she's my go to.</p>
