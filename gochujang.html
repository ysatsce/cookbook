    <h3>Gochujang Sauce</h3>
    <div class="info">
        <p>I think this was the first thing I cooked for you that I actually trialed and errored myself. It's 
            the bright red, sweet and spicy sauce that we had a couple of times with tofu. I always use about
            <b>1/2 pound of tofu</b>, but if you use chicken you can add more since it doesn't soak up the sauce the
            same way. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="recipe">
        <h4>Ingredients (recipe makes about 3 portions)</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp <b>butter</b> or some other solid fat</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp <b>gochujang paste</b> (the more you add, the spicier the sauce is)</li>
            <li>3-4 tbsp <b>honey</b></li>
            <li>3-4 tbsp <b>soy sauce</b>(careful with the soy sauce, it can end up insanely salty)</li>
            <li>2 <b>garlic cloves</b> or 2 tsp <b>garlic paste</b></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop up your garlic as fine as possible (or use a garlic paste)</li>
            <li>Add butter, gochujang, honey and soy sauce on a pan and mix on medium heat
                until everything is evenly combined (this might take a few minutes!)</li>
            <li>Let the sauce thicken a bit while occasionally stirring</li>
            <li>Once it's thicker and in a simmer, add your garlic and let that cook for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down and add the protein of your choice (if you use tofu, make sure you've
                pressed most of the liquid out of it! If you use chicken, make sure to cook it first)</li>
            <li>Once your protein is warmed up, you're done :)</li>
        </ol>

        <p><br>Pretty simple I hope! This recipe is easy to modify too: if it's too salty, just reduce the amount
            of soy sauce and/or add a few tablespoons of water. If too spicy, reduce gochujang. You get the deal!
