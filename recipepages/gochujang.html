    <h3>Gochujang Sauce</h3>
    <div class="info">
        <p>I think this was the first thing I cooked for you that I actually trialed and errored myself. In its original 
            form the sauce was a marinade for chicken (which you can still do I guess), but now it's more of a sauce. It's 
            the bright red, sweet and spicy sauce that we had a couple of times with tofu. It's good with chicken too, I 
            have never tried it with beef. Very easy to make, probably best with rice!

    <div class="recipe">
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp butter or some other solid fat</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp gochujang paste (the more you add, the spicier the sauce is)</li>
            <li>3-4 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>3-4 tbsp soy sauce (careful with the soy sauce, it can end up insanely salty)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves or 2 tsp garlic paste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop up your garlic into SMALL pieces</li>
            <li>Add butter, gochujang, honey and soy sauce on a pan and mix on medium heat
                until everything is evenly combined</li>
            <li>Let the sauce thicken a bit while occasionally stirring - about 2 mins should be good</li>
            <li>Once it's a bit thicker, add your garlic and let that cook for a few minutes</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down and add the protein of your choice. If you use tofu, make sure you've
                pressed most of the liquid out of it! If you use chicken, make sure to cook it first.</li>
        </ol>
