        <h4>How did this page come to be?</h4>
        <p>Andrew, it is so difficult to buy gifts for you. You either buy whatever 
            you want or need by yourself, or you just don't express anything you'd want! 
            You're not exactly materialistic either, so I wanted to get you stuff that is 
            at least somewhat useful. I also wanted to make you something kind of personal, 
            and unfortunately my chrocheting skills are not good enough (yet) to make you a 
            beanie or something useful like that. I'll probably try eventually, but not yet! 
            The good part about this too is that I can keep updating it as long as GitHub allows 
            me. We'll see how many recipes I can come up with!
        </p>

        <h4>Credits</h4>
        <p>I'll give credit when it's due, and I got a lot of help through a website called
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a>. It's been a while since I took
            my web dev class, and that website helped me get back on track with the basics. At 
            first I was also looking into buying or leasing a domain for this and a host, but then
            came across a Reddit post that explained how GitHub can be used to start an HTML portfolio 
            for free. I'm not sure if there'll be some limit to hit with the amount of HTML pages I 
            can creat, but I'm not worried about that (yet).
        </p>

        <h4>Website doesn't work?</h4>
        <p>Honestly, I probably won't know how to fix it. I can try, but genuinely no promises. The 
            most likely problem will be that I'm udpating the site and forget to commit the changes 
            from my local directories onto the public one. Just text me if something seems odd and 
            I'll try my best :)
